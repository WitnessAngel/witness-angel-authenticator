Witness Angel Keygen
#############################

This Kivy GUI allows one to list and initialize WitnessAngel "authentication devices",
i.e. USB keys containing a set of public/private keypairs for use with "write only"
encryption systems.

Instead of pip, we use `poetry <https://github.com/sdispater/poetry>`_ to install dependencies.
